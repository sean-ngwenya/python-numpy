# Python NumPy Fundamentals

A structured and practical introduction to NumPy, with a strong emphasis on
linear algebra concepts and numerical computing using Python.

This repository focuses on understanding NumPy as the mathematical foundation
for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing.
